# Modularized GraphQL Boilerplate with Testing
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/WhatTheFar/modularizing-graphql-boilerplate/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/WhatTheFar/modularizing-graphql-boilerplate/tree/master)

Fully-feature modularized GraphQL Server boilerplate with production-ready containerized workflow.

## Overview

* Easiest way to run a GraphQL server: Sensible defaults & includes everything you need with minimal setup.
* Practical: Built-in scripts to facilitate common workflows.
* Production-ready: Containerized with nginx and letsencrypt configuration.
* Testability: Including complete testing environment wih modular package.

This project is based on the following libraries & tools:
* [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga): Fully-featured GraphQL server framework
* [`graphql-shield`](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield): GraphQL Server permissions as another layer of abstraction!
* [`merge-graphql-schemas`](https://github.com/okgrow/merge-graphql-schemas): A utility library to facilitate merging of modularized GraphQL schemas and resolver objects.
* [`prisma`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma): GraphQL ORM-like* layer  between between your GraphQL API and database
* [`prisma-binding`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-binding): GraphQL Binding for Prisma services (GraphQL Database)
* [`graphql-playground`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground): Interactive GraphQL IDE

## Getting started

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add
environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`.

See `.env.example` for example.

### Clean project

To clean the project run following command(s).

```sh
bash scripts/clean-local.sh
```

> **Note:** Recommended for the first run.

### Run the project

1. (Optional) Clean project, follow [Clean Project](#clean-project) topic above. (Recommended if you run for the first time).
2. Start GraphQL server:
   ```sh
   bash scripts/run-local.sh
   ```
3. (Optional) Start [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground):
   ```sh
   bash scripts/graphql-playground.sh
   ```
   **NOTE:** To use desktop version of GraphQL Playground, download it from [releases](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground/releases) or [install via Homebrew](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground#installation).

**NOTE:** This is a recommended method to run local dev server, but there is also an [alternative method](#run-the-project-(alternative)) to optimise development cycle.

### Seed the database
Seed initial data to database for development.

1. Make sure you have [run the project](#run-the-project)  once.
2. Recommended for an empty database. If database is dirty, there might occurs some error during the seed.
3. Seed the database:
    ```sh
    bash scripts/run-seed.sh
    ```

### Run the project (alternative)

This method is recommended for advanced docker user. See [`setup-dev.sh`](scripts/setup-dev.sh), [`run-dev.sh`](scripts/run-dev.sh) for more details of the scripts.

1. Make sure you have [run the project](#run-the-project) once, or run the  following command to install dependencies.
    ```sh
    yarn
    ```
2. Setting up dev environment:
   ```sh
   bash scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ```
3. Run the test:
    ```sh
    bash scripts/run-dev.sh
    # OR
    bash scripts/run-debug.sh # To run server in debug mode
    ```
    **NOTE**: Debugger listening on port 9229, repeat step 3 to run server again

## Testing

### Run the test

1. Make sure you have [run the project](#run-the-project) once.
2. Setting up test environment:
   ```sh
   bash scripts/setup-test.sh
   ```
3. Run the test:
    ```sh
    bash scripts/run-test.sh
    # OR
    bash scripts/run-watch-test.sh # To run test in watch mode
    ```
    **NOTE**: Repeat step 3 to run test again

## Build & Deploy

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml build --force-rm
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
